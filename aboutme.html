            <h2>About Me:</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Jethro Hermawan.
                I was born in 2003 and come from Indonesia.
                Not much about me, but I am a passionate Electronic
                Dance Music producer and love playing video games.
                As a matter of fact, I am looking to become a video game programmer
                after my Bachelor's degree at Simon Fraser University.
                I decided to pursue software developer when I was 13 years old.
                One day, I woke up in the morning and decided to play a multiplayer game.
                Suddenly, I got bored and downloaded Unreal Engine. I learned about it for months
                until I quit because Unreal Engine was too much for me at the time.
                It was also the first time I knew the existence of C++ and how important
                C++ is to make softwares. Hence, the reason why I wanted to pursue Software Developer.
                I didn't get to learn coding until I was 15 years old when my teacher taught python.
                I wasn't really passionate in coding because my passion switched to music producing; however,
                I am still looking forward to become a programmer at any video game company.
